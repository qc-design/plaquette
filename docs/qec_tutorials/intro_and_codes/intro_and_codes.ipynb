    "# Introduction to Fault Tolerance and Quantum Error Correction\n",
    "\n",
    "Fault Tolerance (FT) and Quantum Error Correction (QEC) are complex concepts and so\n",
    "it is worth asking: why study them at all?\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an honest question, mostly because if you are approaching the field of\n",
    "quantum computing for the first time, getting your feet wet with cool concepts\n",
    "like QKD or quantum algorithms, most of the time the introductory material about\n",
    "these topics make a tiny assumption: you have perfect qubits. Not only that, you\n",
    "are actually dealing with perfect *logical* qubits\n",
    "\n",
    "If your curiosity was struck by press releases and articles in non-technical\n",
    "journals, these concepts might be foreign. We put emphasis on *logical* qubit,\n",
    "so what other qubits are there to talk about? We usually distinguish between\n",
    "logical and *physical* qubits. The latter are the ones we routinely make and\n",
    "manipulate in the lab, but they are too fragile to be used as reliably as we\n",
    "need them to. Physical qubits constantly and inevitably interact with their\n",
    "environment, and the gates we act on them can never be perfect. Together, this\n",
    "makes it hard to use and reason about them in a deterministic way.\n",
    "\n",
    "That’s fault tolerance is paramount. You will never be able to completely remove\n",
    "this inherent fragility in the physical qubits you are given, so you need to\n",
    "tolerate their problems, and fault tolerance is about coming up with clever ways\n",
    "to blend multiple physical qubits together in such a way that when used to make\n",
    "a single logical qubit you can be fairly confident that it will behave as you’ve\n",

    "\n",
    "There wouldn’t be any reason to specialize *quantum* error correction, if there\n",
    "were no other type of error correction. Classical information theory has been\n",
    "dealing with similar problems – reliably transmitting information – for a very\n",

    "The basics are simple: Alice wants to transmit a message and there is some\n",
    "probability $ p $ that Bob (the message recipient) actually gets a corrupted\n",
    "version of it. This is because Alice is using some noisy channel to send this\n",
    "message, which might introduce errors. Think about talking to another person\n",
    "across a very noisy street. If the traffic passing through is too loud\n",
    "($ p $ is high enough), chances are Bob on the other side won’t understand\n",
    "Alice. So, given a certain noise level, is there a way we can increase Bob’s\n",
    "confidence that he received the message that Alice actually wanted to send?\n",
    "\n",
    "One strategy is to protect the message by encoding each bit of information into\n",
    "multiple bits. This process of adding extra information to a message to protect\n",
    "it against errors is called **redundancy**. One encoding strategy that achieves\n",
    "this is the classical repetition code: Alice knows the street is noisy and,\n",
    "instead of trusting Bob’s stellar hearing, she simply repeats what she wants to\n",
    "say a few times. If we now use more technical terms, Alice wants to encode her\n",
    "original *bit* of information, which we will now refer to as the “logical bit”,\n",
    "into three bits. Alice is moving from a space with one dimension, which we call\n",
    "the logical space, to a much larger space with 3 dimensions (three basis\n",
    "elements, $ {001, 010, 100} $). Both of these spaces are defined over the\n",
    "same finite-field of order 2, which makes them finite vector spaces, whose set\n",
    "of vectors have cardinality 2 and 8, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "To implement **error correction** using redundancy, Alice must define a subspace\n",
    "that has the same cardinality as the original (logical) space. In other words,\n",
    "she takes elements from the larger space to stand in representation of the\n",
    "elements that she had in her logical space. In the case of the repetition code,\n",
    "Alice uses the element $ 000 $ to represent the original $ 0 $ from her\n",
    "logical space, and thus $ 000 $ receives the name of logical $ 0 $, or\n",
