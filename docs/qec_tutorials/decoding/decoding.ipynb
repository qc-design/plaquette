    "recently proposed, and it is able to find a correction in almost-linear time!\n",
    "\n",
    "This algorithm consists of two sub-algorithms:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The Maximum Likelihood decoder for erasures (also known as “peeling decoder”). This is\n",
    "  an algorithm that corrects for a specific type of error: the erasure. An erasure is an\n",
    "  error where a qubit has been physically lost or where the information of the qubit has\n",
    "  been erased. An erasure is well-located within the code. Whenever a qubit is erased, we\n",
    "  know with full certainty which one it is. The qubit is then replaced by *or reinitialised\n",
    "  as a qubit in a completely mixed state, i.e., the state of this qubit is in the\n",
    "  correct state with probability of $ 25\\% $ or it will have an $ X $, $ Y $\n",
    "  or $ Z $ error, each with a probability of $ 25\\% $ [Delfosse, 2020].  \n",
    "  Whenever we have an erasure (i.e., a set of erased qubits), we can create a sub-set\n",
    "  $ \\mathcal{R} $ of the edges supported by these qubits in the graph. We can do\n",
    "  this because the location of the erased qubits is well-known! We also perform our\n",
    "  stabilizer measurements to obtain the syndrome of a given error.  \n",
    "  The peeling decoder works as follows: first, the erasure is identified on the\n",
    "  decoding graph as a subset of edges. Second, we remove edges from the erasure in\n",
    "  such a way that the erasure sub-graph contains no loops (a path of edges that\n",
    "  returns to a previously visited vertex). This loop-less graph, called a *forest*,\n",
    "  should contain as many edges from the original erasure as possible. This process\n",
    "  can be done by choosing a seed (if the code has an open boundary, then the open\n",
    "  vertices are first chosen as seeds), and *walking* through the erasure by adding\n",
    "  edges if only one of its vertices is already in the forest. If both vertices are\n",
    "  already in the forest, the edge is discarded. If a connected sub-graph is not\n",
    "  connected to an open vertex, we can choose randomly any of its vertices as the\n",
    "  seed. The figure below shows how the forest is created in a graph of a planar code\n",
    "  of distance $ 4 $ (we are only showing the edges that represent $ Z $\n",
    "  errors for simplicity):  \n",
    "  <img src=\"qec_tutorials/decoding/forest.png\" style=\"width:300px;\">\n",
    "  \n",
    "  Finally, the forest is peeled from its *leaves*. We call a *leaf* an edge that is\n",
    "  connected to the rest of the erasure through only one of its vertices, while the\n",
    "  other vertex, which we call *pendant vertex* is disconnected from the erasure.  \n",
    "  When removing a leaf, if the pendant vertex **is not** a syndrome vertex, then we\n",
    "  continue and remove another leaf. If the pendant vertex **is** also a syndrome\n",
    "  vertex, then the edge is added to the correction operator. Then, the state of the\n",
    "  non-pendant vertex of the leaf is flipped: if the non-pendant vertex was a syndrome\n",
    "  vertex, then it will no longer be a syndrome vertex; if the non-pendant vertex\n",
    "  wasn’t a syndrome vertex, it will now become a syndrome vertex. Below you can find\n",
    "  an example of how the peeling is performed, and how the correction is obtained.  \n",
    "  <img src=\"qec_tutorials/decoding/peeling.png\" style=\"width:300px;\">\n",
    "  \n",
    "  This decoding algorithm works only for erasures. The extra information regarding\n",
    "  the location of the erasures is what gives this algorithm a linear complexity. One\n",
    "  of the decoder’s requirements is that every connected subgraph within the erasure\n",
    "  must have an even number of syndrome vertices **or** it must be connected to an\n",
    "  open vertex.  \n",
    "- Syndrome validation [Delfosse, 2021]. As we claimed, the peeling decoder works only\n",
    "  with erasures, because it requires a subgraph within the code’s decoding graph\n",
    "  containing the edges that correspond to erased qubits. The peeling decoder cannot be\n",
    "  used to correct for Pauli errors, because the only information that can be retrieved\n",
    "  from these errors is the syndrome. We are missing the erasure. Because of this, the\n",
    "  syndrome validation takes as input a pre-processed erasure (which can be empty) and a\n",
    "  syndrome and attempts to create a *virtual* erasure that fulfills the requirements set\n",
    "  by the peeling decoder: to have an erasure, and that each connected subgraph within the\n",
    "  erasure must have an even number of syndrome vertices or be connected to an open vertex.  \n",
    "  The syndrome validation works as follows: it first identifies within the graph the\n",
    "  real erasure (again, might be empty) as a subset of edges, and the syndrome\n",
    "  vertices within the syndrome graph. Then, it identifies *clusters*. A cluster is a\n",
    "  connected sub-graph within the erasure. A cluster can be as small as a single\n",
    "  vertex (which, in this case, would be a single syndrome vertex). Then, one creates\n",
