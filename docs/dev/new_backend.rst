How to create a new backend?
============================

The error correction pipeline of plaquette involves running the quantum circuit that represents a quantum error correcting code. To run the quantum circuit on a quantum device, plaquette provides the :class:`.Device` object which can be used with various backends, for example with the Clifford local backend:

.. code-block:: python

    from plaquette import Device
    device = Device("clifford")
    device.run(circuit)

The :class:`.Device` object maintains a backend object under the hood. While
plaquette comes with built-in backends, it is also extensible and new backends
can be developed and integrated into plaquette.

A new backend can be created via the following steps:

1. Create a new backend class (we suggest naming the backend class such that it has ``Backend`` as a suffix in its name);
2. Implement the set of required (and in addition the optional) backend methods and properties (as detailed below);
3. Package your new device backend into a separate Python package;
4. In the ``pyproject.toml`` file of the Python package

The following section may be placed in the ``pyproject.toml`` file:

.. code-block:: toml

    [project.entry-points."plaquette.device"]
    my_backend_name = "plaquette_my_backend.backend:MyBackend"

where ``my_backend_name`` will be the name that can be passed to :class:`.Device` to use the new backend, the new backend package name is ``plaquette_my_backend`` and the backend implementation is represented with the ``MyBackend`` class which is placed in the ``backend`` module of the package.

We refer to the `plaquette-ibm-backend <https://github.com/qc-design/plaquette-ibm-backend>`_ package as an example of a backend plugin for exact packaging details.

Backend API
-----------

The set of required backend methods and their signatures are:

* The ``run`` method to run a quantum circuit.

.. code-block:: python

    run(self, circuit: plaq_circuit.Circuit | plaq_circuit.CircuitBuilder, *,shots=1)

* The ``get_sample`` method to return the samples **after a circuit run**.

.. code-block:: python

    get_sample(self) -> Tuple[List[Union[List[Any], Any]], Optional[List[None]]]

Remote backends may also implement the ``is_completed(self) -> List[bool]``
property that determines which jobs have been completed for the list of jobs
submitted using the device.

Simulators that allow obtaining the underlying quantum state of the backend may
also define the ``state`` property to access such a state.

Furthermore, all arguments and keyword arguments passed to :class:`.Device` upon creation are later passed to the underlying backend object. Therefore, custom methods and properties may also be implemented in new backends that may take arguments passed at the time of creation.
