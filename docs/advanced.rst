===============

In this page you can find some more in-depth explanations about some of the
features of ``plaquette``. ``plaquette`` tries to be as easy to use as
possible, but it can't possibly foresee all uses people might have for it.
In particular, it's hard to do *research* if the software you try to use never
lets go of its training wheels.

   If you think you have an idea that might be useful to many QEC researchers,
   you're welcome to make a
   `pull-request <https://github.com/qcdesign/plaquette>`_ to have it added to
   the main code base!
